<!-- WEEK 1 CODE CHALLANGE: -->

CHALLANGE 1 (STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR)
   Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 

    A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

(SOLUTION): 
Challange 1 is written in the grade.js file and uses node grade.js to run the program written.
It uses the if/else conditions to convert marks that the user is prompted to input and converts it's corresponding grade.


CHALLANGE 2 (SPEED DETECTOR)
    Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
 
(SOLUTION): 
Challange 2 is written in the speed.js file and uses node speed.js to run the program written.
It uses the if/else conditions to convert speed that the user is prompted to input so as to detect the speed of the user and hence issues demerit points to drivers above (70) speed limit.


CHALLANGE 3 (SPEED DETECTOR)
    Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary. 

 (SOLUTION): 
Challange 3 is written in the salary_calc.js file and uses node salary_calc.js to run the program written.
It uses the if/else conditions to convert gross salary that the user is prompted to input so as to calculate the paye, determine NHIF deductions, and also NSSF deductions which is monthly and equally deducted from every employee regardless of the gross salary.
Hence net salary is calculated by deducting the gross salary from the total deductions(NHIF, NSSF and paye)
  i.e   Gross salary - (paye + NHIF + NSSF)
